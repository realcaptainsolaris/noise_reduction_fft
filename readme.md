# Noise Reduction with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to reduce noise from a signal using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to analyze a noisy signal, filter it in the frequency domain, and reconstruct the cleaned signal.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realcaptainsolaris/noise_reduction_fft 
   cd noise_reduction_fft
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `noise_reduction_fft.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**  
   Execute the cells step by step to:
   - Generate a noisy signal.
   - Analyze it in the frequency domain using FFT.
   - Filter out unwanted noise.
   - Reconstruct and visualize the cleaned signal.

## Features

- Simulates a noisy time-domain signal.
- Demonstrates FFT-based frequency analysis and noise filtering.
- Interactive visualizations of signal processing steps.

You can modify the notebook to work with custom signals or extend the methods for more complex use cases.
